You are working on an existing Billdesk page and a real-time admin panel that already works correctly for card-based submissions.

You must add and integrate a UPI payment section while keeping all existing functionality unchanged.


🧾 Scope Clarification (Very Important)
This is NOT real payment processing
This is a UI + data-flow simulation
No gateway integration
No real money movement
Only frontend + backend event handling (same as existing card submissions)

1️⃣ UPI SECTION — BILLDESK PAGE (FRONTEND)
Required Behavior
Add / modify the UPI ID input section on the Billdesk page.
When the user:

Enters a UPI ID
Clicks the Pay button
The following must happen:


2️⃣ REAL-TIME DATA FLOW TO ADMIN PANEL
Immediately upon clicking Pay:

Send the following data to backend:

payment_type: "UPI"
upi_id
amount
timestamp
Emit this data via Socket.IO
Display it in the admin panel instantly, in:

The same list
The same format
The same position
where card submissions appear
The only difference:

It must be clearly marked as UPI submission

3️⃣ ADMIN PANEL — COMMANDS FOR UPI SUBMISSIONS
Each UPI submission must have these commands (same UI style as card commands):

✅ Success
❌ Fail
⚠️ Invalid UPI
🚫 Payment Declined
💰 Balance Low
⚠️ Note:

These commands only trigger backend routes/events
I will implement backend logic later
For now, wire buttons to placeholder handlers/events

4️⃣ LOADING STATE (CRITICAL UX REQUIREMENT)
After clicking Pay on UPI section:

Show a loading spinner
Duration: 3–4 seconds
During loading:

Entire screen background turns white
Background content becomes blurred
Spinner is centered
No interaction allowed during loading

5️⃣ REDIRECT TO NEW UPI PAGE (AFTER LOADING)
After loading completes:

Automatically redirect to a new page
You must create this page from scratch

6️⃣ NEW UPI PAGE — EXACT DESIGN REPLICATION
Reference
I have provided a reference image file
File name: refrence upi page new image
Requirements
Carefully study the image
Rebuild the page pixel-by-pixel as closely as possible
Match everything, including:

Layout
Colors
Fonts
Spacing
Icons
Logos
Text content
Alignment
Button styles
Borders
Backgrounds
⚠️ No placeholders
⚠️ No approximations
⚠️ No redesigns


7️⃣ TIMER FUNCTIONALITY (MANDATORY)
The page must include a countdown timer
Starts at: 10:00 minutes
Counts down to: 0:00
Updates every second
On timeout:

Show timeout state (as visible in reference image)
Disable further interaction

8️⃣ FLOW SUMMARY (END-TO-END)
User enters UPI ID on Billdesk page
Clicks Pay
Data is sent to backend + admin panel instantly
Loading spinner shown (3–4 seconds)
Redirect to newly created UPI page
Timer starts at 10:00
Admin can act on UPI submission in real time

🚫 DO NOT CHANGE
Existing card flow
Admin panel UI
Socket.IO architecture
Submission storage logic
Database structure (unless required to add UPI type)
Styling outside UPI flow

✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
UPI submissions appear instantly in admin panel
Commands show correctly
Loading and blur work smoothly
New page matches reference image exactly
Timer works correctly
No regression in existing features

🛑 IMPORTANT — BEFORE YOU IMPLEMENT
Before writing any code:

Summarize back what you understood
List exactly what files/pages you will modify or add
Confirm you can access and see the reference image
Ask any clarification questions if something is unclear
Do NOT proceed to implementation until confirmation is complete.
