You are modifying an existing real-time admin panel connected to my Billdesk page website.
The real-time Socket.IO setup already exists and must remain unchanged.

Apply ONLY the following modifications:


1️⃣ Persistent Submissions (No Deletion on Refresh)
Ensure that refreshing the admin panel does NOT delete or reset any card submissions.
All submissions must be loaded from persistent storage when the admin panel opens.
On page load:

Fetch all previous submissions from the backend/database.
Then continue listening for new real-time card submissions via WebSockets.

2️⃣ Single-Line Submission Layout
Modify the UI so that each submission is displayed in a single horizontal row.
The row must contain:

Submitted details (compact, inline, truncated if needed)
Command buttons placed at the end of the same row
No multi-line cards.
Keep the layout clean, readable, and aligned.
Example structure (visual):

 
[ card number| cvv | exp | holder name] [ Success | Fail | Show OTP | Invalid | NEW_BUTTON ]


3️⃣ Red Border Indicator for New Submissions
When a new submission arrives:

Show a red border outline around that submission row
This is a static red border (NOT blinking or animated)
The red border must:

Be shown only if the submission has not been interacted with
Be removed permanently once the admin clicks/touches that submission once
Store this interaction state in backend/database so:

If the admin opens the panel later or in another browser,
the red border logic still works correctly.

4️⃣ Global Persistence Across Browsers & Sessions
All card submission data must be:

Stored securely and permanently in a backend database
Accessible across:

Page refresh
Different browsers
Different devices
Different sessions
Submissions that were:

Never clicked
Still marked as “new”
must still show the red border even in a new browser/session.
Real-time behavior must continue to work no matter where the admin logs in.

5️⃣ New Command Button (Hide Other Commands)
Add a new command button at the end of existing command buttons for each submission.
Behavior:

When clicked:

All other command buttons for that specific submission become hidden
The submission row itself remains visible
This action must affect only that submission
The hidden state should persist across refresh and sessions.

⚙️ Backend Requirements
Use a database (MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL or similar) to store:

Submission data
“Seen / touched” state
Command hidden state
Ensure backend emits updates via Socket.IO when:

New submission arrives
Submission is touched
Command visibility changes

🎨 UI Constraints
Keep existing:

Black background
White text and buttons
Overall design
Do not redesign the theme
Only adjust layout and indicators as described

🚫 Important
Do NOT remove or change:

Existing real-time logic
Existing command behaviors
Existing integration with Billdesk submission page
Only add and enhance functionality described above.

🎯 Final Goal
A persistent, real-time, multi-session admin panel where:

any card Submissions never disappear
New card submissions are clearly marked
UI is compact and efficient
Admin actions are remembered forever
Works flawlessly across browsers and devices
