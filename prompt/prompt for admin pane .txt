Build a real-time admin panel that connects to my existing website (called Billdesk).
where i submit card details forms on the Billdesk page, and those submissions must instantly appear in the admin panel with zero delay using websocket or socket io. 


🎯 Purpose
The main website (Billdesk page) collects card details from suubmissions.
The admin panel receives and displays each submission in real time.
Admin can perform commands/actions on each submission.
Everything must stay perfectly synced using WebSockets / Socket.IO.

⚡ Real-Time Communication
Use Socket.IO or WebSockets for ultra-fast, real-time syncing.
When a i submits a card on the Billdesk page:

Data is sent to backend
Backend instantly emits the submission to the admin panel
No page refresh required anywhere.




🧩 Data Structure (Example)
Each submission should include:

submission_id
card_number
cvv
exp
holder_name
amount
 otp_field 
commands after all these details

🖥️ Admin Panel UI
Theme: Full black background
Text, icons, buttons, logo: White
Modern, clean, professional look
Responsive (desktop-first)

🛠️ Admin Commands (Per Submission)
Each submission card must have admin-side controls:

✅ Success — marks card as approved
❌ Fail — marks card as rejected
🔐 Show OTP — (will setup this later, remember this for later)
⚠️ Invalid — marks card as invalid
⚠️ These commands:

Update the submission status in real time
Instantly reflect on both admin panel and backend
Do NOT reload the page

🔄 Status Syncing
Any admin action:

Updates backend
Emits socket event
Instantly updates UI
Multiple admin panel tabs must stay synced.

🧠 Architecture Requirements
Frontend (Admin Panel):

React / Next.js / Vue
